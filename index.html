                <h2>Ready For His Closeup</h2>
                <p>Mr. Pickles is a very spoiled tuxedo cat. He is always ready for his closeup, especially today. He
                    is turning eight years old this upcoming February. He found his home in February 2019 after living
                    in his future family’s wood pile as a stray kitten. Very skinny and skittish, he was slowly
                    introduced into the house. Now, he acts like he owns the place and is extremely ungrateful. But,
                    he’s so cute! Read more about Mr. Pickles (link)</p>

                <h2>The Duality of Mr. P</h2>
                <p>Mr. Pickles can be a sweet cat, but only on his own terms. Sometimes, he loves his little sister
                    Lilo, a four year old Tortise Shell cat. At times you can find them cuddling on the couch or on one
                    of their many cat beds. But other times, you can find Mr. Pickles telling Lilo to go away, and she
                    does. She runs to the basement. Visit our Lilo & Mr. P Gallery (link) </p>
